## Overview
ChaosPad is a macropad designed specifically for me, with every switch being. It features a 3x3 grid of buttons, an OLED display, and a rotary encoder. The macropad is also designed to be easily customizable and programmable, allowing users to create their own macros and shortcuts. It has all of the main components of a macropad, including 9 programmable switches, a rotary encoder, and an OLED display. The layout is designed to be compact and efficient, with all of the components easily accessible.
